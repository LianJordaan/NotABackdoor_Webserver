# NotABackdoor_Webserver

This is not intended to be a backdoor, but can resemble the look of one.
It is archived, because I am working on a plugin that will contain all plugins and the webserver in one, and will also be more secure.

**Please note that this repository is no longer actively maintained. I am working on a better version of this project in a new repository: [NotABackdoor](https://github.com/LianJordaan/NotABackdoor).**
